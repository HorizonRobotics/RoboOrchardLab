"""Policy components and utilities.

A policy is a function or a model that maps observations from the
environment to actions. It can be deterministic or stochastic, and it is
typically used in reinforcement learning to decide what action to take
based on the current state of the environment.

Policy is a specialized form of inference pipeline, which includes
additional components for interacting with the environment, such as
action sampling and state management.
