    """A high-level, concrete implementation of an end-to-end inference pipeline.

    Like `Pipeline` in huggingface transformers, this class provides a user-friendly
    interface for performing inference with a model, handling all necessary steps
    such as pre-processing, batching, model forwarding, and post-processing.

    The defined workflow in the `__call__` method is:

    1. Pre-process the raw input data using the configured processor.

    2. Collate the processed data into a mini-batch.

    3. Perform model inference (forward pass).

    4. Post-process the model's output using the processor.
